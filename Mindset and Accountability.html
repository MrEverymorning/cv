    <h1>Mindset and Accountability</h1>
    <h3>a short essay</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Accountability is reporting on fulfilling my responsibilities to the appropriate people.  For example, I always report to my wife what I've learned or done in a day.  Partly that's because I take everyday seriously.  When I see my wife at the end of a day, I impulsively feel a desire to share my day with her, my successes and failures, and my goals for tomorrow.</p>
    <p>I've gotten thirty five star ratings on my little business.  That because I follow through, I keep in contact if I'm behind schedule, and I always make sure I know, and the client knows, what needs to be done, how it's going to be done, and what happens if a variable arises.</p>
<p>Mindset.  What is my mindset?  I love the daoist tradition of eating only until you are 80% full.  In my own experience, life is always better if we allow ourselves to be both grateful and hungry.  Life is not about indulgence or waiting to hit it big.  </p>
<p>If I'm too hungry for success, I can get overwhelmed.  Success often comes slow, and with patience and consistency.  Life is more of a marathon than a sprint.  </p>
<p>However, if I'm too content, I'll become stagnant, comfortable, and unprepared for challenges.  I'll start to become irritable, or lazy, complacent, or redundant.   </p>
<p> I code eight hours a day, but I take breaks every 25 minutes to do yoga, take a walk.  Sometimes I do nothing for thirty minutes, meditating.  Sometimes I'll be coding and I'll get a spiritual thought.  Sometimes I'm with my wife.  But I believe that amidst all of this, it's important to listen to my feelings, and never overwhelm myself, nor to loosen the cords on my discipline. </p>
